        question:"What if we want a community owned project?        ",
        answer:"GoodRenewable only engages developers where the community has shown support for a  project that requires commercial input. We stay completely neutral in the initial engagement  process so communities have the choice to propose projects that are community owned or part-owned as they wish. Our resources are designed to inform community members of the   potential benefits and limitations of different ownership models to be sure they can put forward a scheme they support.",

        question:"How is the wider community consulted?        ",
        answer:"We understand the initial planning workshops donâ€™t involve the whole community. We run a wider consultation process open to all community members to show their views on the project  proposals put forward by the initial community workshops. The consultation includes informationabout the proposed ownership model and potential benefit schemes that could be part of the   project.",

        id:3,
        question:"What are the potential community benefits? ",
        answer:"There are a wide range of benefits that renewable energy projects can bring depending on their  structure and ownership model. This can include revenue directly to community owners,revenue-share to locally-administered community benefit funds, or even agreements to fund local services and infrastructure. Communities are free to propose their preferred options to beput forward. The exact benefits will depend on the detail of the final project plans, so weencourage and facilitate communities to have an ongoing dialogue with developers as projects  move forward.",

    },
    {
        id:4,
        question:"What if developers change the project?        ",
        answer:"There are almost always changes to projects as they are developed with detailed technical and environmental surveys. For projects to be built they need to receive final approval from local authorities at the end of the development process. This requires community consent. So any changes will need to be consented by the community for a project to go ahead. GoodRenewable encourages and facilitates ongoing dialogue between communities,  developers and landowners to ensure everyone is consulted throughout the process.",

        question:"How does GoodRenewable work with landowners? ",
        answer:"Once a community has proposed a project we essentially act as an agent for landowners. We  work with them to put together a proposed site for the community-support project and market this proposal to our network of developers.",

    },
    {
        id:2,
        question:"Am I free to choose the developer and terms of agreement?",
        answer:"Absolutely. Landowners make the final decision on the developer they want to work with, and the terms of any agreement they enter into. We help landowners navigate the negotiation and  contracting process to ensure landowners get the best deal and the project has the best chance of success.",

    },
    {
        id:3,
        question:"Do you charge fees to landowners? ",
        answer:"No. GoodRenewable is funded by subscriptions developers pay to see projects on our platform  as well as success fees they pay on projects that are taken through to construction. If a project  goes ahead all lease fees are paid directly from the developer to the landowner without commission.",
